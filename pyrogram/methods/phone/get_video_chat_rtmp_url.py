        Parameters
        ----------
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat. A chat can be either a basic group, supergroup or a channel.

            replace (``bool``, *optional*):
                Whether to replace the previous stream key or simply return the existing one. Defaults to False, i.e., return the existing one.

        Returns
        -------
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.RtmpUrl`: On success, the RTMP URL and stream key is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                await app.get_stream_rtmp_url(chat_id)

        """
        peer = await self.resolve_peer(chat_id)

            msg = "Target chat should be group, supergroup or channel."
            raise ValueError(msg)

            raw.functions.phone.GetGroupCallStreamRtmpUrl(
                peer=peer,

            ),
        )

        return types.RtmpUrl._parse(r)
